# odin-recipes
First practice project

This recipe page is my first real project on my path to becoming a skilled web-dev, im thankful to be able to have this oportunity to dive into learning something that will improve the lives of those around me.

By the end of this project i hope to have a solid grasp of html/css, and the command line, as i am building this on a linux vm. Hopefully by the end of this project i will also gain better confidence in myself.
